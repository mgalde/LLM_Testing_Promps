Below is a logic puzzle with multiple clues. Please solve it and explain every step of your reasoning in detail. Do not jump to conclusionsâ€”show your work by considering each clue one by one. 
Puzzle:  

    Goal:  Find a 3-digit code using the digits 1 to 9 with no repeating digits. 

    Clues:  

        The correct code shares exactly one digit with 142 , and that digit is in the same position as in 142 . 

        None of the digits in the correct code appear in 683 . 

        The correct code shares exactly one digit with 816 , but this digit is in a different position than it is in 816 . 

        The correct code shares exactly one digit with 852 , but this digit is in a different position than it is in 852 . 

        The correct code shares exactly one digit with 347 , but this digit is in a different position than it is in 347 . 
         
     

Instructions: Use each clue in order to eliminate impossible digits and positions. Clearly explain which digits are eliminated or fixed at each step, and finally, verify that the code you determine satisfies all clues.

### Puzzle: Decode the Secret Number

You need to determine a three-digit code based on the following clues. Each clue relates to how the digits in the correct code correspond with specific numbers, either by sharing a digit or avoiding certain digits.

1. **Clue 1:** The secret code has exactly one digit that matches both the value and position of a digit from the number **142**.
   
2. **Clue 2:** None of the digits in the secret code appear in the number **683**.

3. **Clue 3:** The secret code shares exactly one digit with the number **816**, but this digit is not in the same position as it appears in **816**.

4. **Clue 4:** The secret code contains exactly one digit from the number **852**, and this digit occupies a different position than it does in **852**.

5. **Clue 5:** There is exactly one digit that the secret code shares with the number **347**, but it must be placed in a different position than in **347**.

### Solution Approach:

To solve, analyze each clue by determining which digits can possibly appear in the secret code and where they could logically fit. Remember:

- Only one digit from **142** is used and correctly positioned.
- No overlap with any of the digits in **683**.
- For clues 3, 4, and 5, ensure only one shared digit per clue, but it must be out of its original position.

Try to piece together these constraints to find a code that satisfies all conditions.
