Let’s denote the unknown 3‐digit code as positions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) (so the code is \(ABC\)). We know that:

- The digits come from 1 to 9, with no repeats.
- We must satisfy all five clues.

We will work step‐by‐step.

---

### **Step 1. Use Clue 2 to Eliminate Digits**

**Clue 2:** “None of the digits in the correct code are present in 683.”

- This eliminates the digits **6**, **8**, and **3**.
- **Remaining possible digits:** \( \{1,2,4,5,7,9\} \).

---

### **Step 2. Apply Clue 3 (About 816)**

**Clue 3:** “The correct code shares exactly one digit with 816, but this digit is in a different position compared to 816.”

- The digits in **816** are **8**, **1**, and **6**.
- **8** and **6** are already eliminated (from Clue 2). So the only candidate is **1**.
- **Conclusion:** The code **must contain 1**.
- In **816**, the digit **1** is in position 2. Therefore, in the code, **1** cannot be in position 2.
- So, **1** must appear in either position \(A\) or position \(C\).

---

### **Step 3. Analyze Clue 1 (About 142)**

**Clue 1:** “The correct code shares exactly one digit with 142, and this digit is in the same position as in 142.”

- The digits in **142** (and their positions) are: 
  - Position 1: **1**
  - Position 2: **4**
  - Position 3: **2**

- We have three cases for which digit is the matching one:
  - **Case A:** \(A=1\). Then the code must not include **4** or **2** in any position.
  - **Case B:** \(B=4\). Then the code must not include **1** or **2** anywhere. But we already must include **1** from Clue 3, so this case is impossible.
  - **Case C:** \(C=2\). Then the code must not include **1** or **4** anywhere. But again, **1** must be in the code, so this case is ruled out.

- **Conclusion:** The only possibility is **Case A:** The matching digit is **1** in position 1.
  - So, the code now starts with **1**: \(A=1\).
  - Also, by Clue 1, digits **4** and **2** cannot appear anywhere in the code.

- **Update the remaining possible digits:** We had \(\{1,2,4,5,7,9\}\) but now remove **2** and **4**. So, remaining digits for positions \(B\) and \(C\) are: \(\{5,7,9\}\).

---

### **Step 4. Apply Clue 4 (About 852)**

**Clue 4:** “The correct code shares exactly one digit with 852, but this digit is in a different position compared to 852.”

- The digits in **852** are: **8**, **5**, and **2**.
- **8** is eliminated by Clue 2 and **2** is not allowed (by Clue 1). So the only possibility is **5**.
- **Conclusion:** The code **must include 5**.
- In **852**, **5** is in position 2. Therefore, in the code, **5** must **not** be in position 2.
- Since position \(A\) is already **1**, **5** must be in position \(C\).
- Now the code looks like: \(1,\, ?,\, 5\).

- Update the remaining possible digits for position \(B\): From \(\{5,7,9\}\) remove **5** (now used), leaving \(\{7,9\}\).

---

### **Step 5. Use Clue 5 (About 347)**

**Clue 5:** “The correct code shares exactly one digit with 347, but this digit is in a different position compared to 347.”

- The digits in **347** are: **3**, **4**, and **7**.
- **3** is eliminated (Clue 2) and **4** is not allowed (from Clue 1). So the only possibility is **7**.
- **Conclusion:** The code **must include 7**.
- In **347**, **7** is in position 3. Therefore, in the code, **7** must not be in position 3.
- Our code already has position \(C=5\) and position \(A=1\), so the only spot for **7** is position \(B\).

- Thus, \(B = 7\).

---

### **Step 6. Assemble the Code and Verify All Clues**

The code we have built is:
\[
A=1,\quad B=7,\quad C=5,
\]
so the code is **175**.

**Verification:**

1. **Clue 1 (with 142):**
   - \(1\mathbf{7}5\) vs. \(1\mathbf{4}2\):
     - Position 1: \(1 = 1\) (match).
     - Positions 2 and 3: \(7 \neq 4\) and \(5 \neq 2\).
   - Exactly one digit (the **1** in position 1) matches in the same place, and **4** and **2** do not appear in **175**.

2. **Clue 2 (with 683):**
   - **175** does not contain **6**, **8**, or **3**.

3. **Clue 3 (with 816):**
   - **816** has digits **8, 1, 6**. Only **1** is common.
   - In **816**, **1** is in position 2; in **175**, **1** is in position 1.
   - The common digit is in a different position.

4. **Clue 4 (with 852):**
   - **852** has digits **8, 5, 2**. Only **5** is common.
   - In **852**, **5** is in position 2; in **175**, **5** is in position 3.
   - The common digit is in a different position.

5. **Clue 5 (with 347):**
   - **347** has digits **3, 4, 7**. Only **7** is common.
   - In **347**, **7** is in position 3; in **175**, **7** is in position 2.
   - The common digit is in a different position.

### **Final Answer**

All clues are satisfied by the code **175**.
