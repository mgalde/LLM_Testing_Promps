Let's break down the riddle:

> "There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle."

At first glance, it sounds like there are multiple ducks arranged in a line.

Let’s imagine the ducks are in a straight line.

Suppose there are **three ducks** in a row:

**Duck A — Duck B — Duck C**

Now let’s analyze:

- **Two ducks in front of a duck**: If we take Duck C, then Duck A and Duck B are in front of it. ✅
- **Two ducks behind a duck**: If we take Duck A, then Duck B and Duck C are behind it. ✅
- **A duck in the middle**: Duck B is in the middle. ✅

But the riddle says "**a duck**" that has two in front, two behind, **and** is in the middle. Wait — can **one duck** satisfy all these?

Let’s re-read carefully:

> "There are two ducks in front of a duck,  
> two ducks behind a duck,  
> and a duck in the middle."

It doesn't necessarily say all these conditions apply to the **same** duck.

But here's a clever interpretation: **Can one duck be the "middle" duck, with two in front and two behind?** That would require 5 ducks.

Wait — no. If a duck has **two in front**, then it must be the **third** duck. If it has **two behind**, then it must be the **third** duck from the back. So if one duck has **two in front** and **two behind**, there would be 2 + 1 + 2 = **5 ducks**.

But the riddle says:

- Two ducks in front of a duck → so one duck has two in front → at least 3 ducks.
- Two ducks behind a duck → one duck has two behind → again, at least 3.
- A duck in the middle.

But here's the key: **Are these describing the same duck?**

Let’s suppose **one duck** has:
- Two ducks in front of it
- Two ducks behind it
- And it is in the middle

That would mean:
- Total ducks = 2 (in front) + 1 (the duck) + 2 (behind) = **5 ducks**

But then the "duck in the middle" would be the third duck — which matches.

But wait — the riddle says "**a duck in the middle**", not "the duck is in the middle".

But let’s consider a simpler possibility.

What if there are **three ducks** in a line:

**Duck 1 — Duck 2 — Duck 3**

Now:
- Two ducks in front of Duck 3 → Duck 1 and Duck 2 → ✅
- Two ducks behind Duck 1 → Duck 2 and Duck 3 → ✅
- A duck in the middle → Duck 2 → ✅

So all three statements are true, but they refer to **different ducks**.

So:
- Two ducks in front of **a duck** (Duck 3)
- Two ducks behind **a duck** (Duck 1)
- And **a duck in the middle** (Duck 2)

So all conditions are satisfied with **3 ducks**.

Thus, the minimum number that satisfies all the statements is **3**.

✅ Final answer: **3 ducks**.
